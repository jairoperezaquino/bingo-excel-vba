## Bingoxcel
April 2020, Covid just started and me and my friends wanted to play some Bingo online, but we couldn't find any online versions that fit the way we usually play it here in Peru.

That's why I decided to code it by myself!

I chose Excel since it's a user-friendly tool that everyone has installed in their machines and to practice some VBA.

It's currently available in Spanish only. Code was written in English.
Hope you lke it!

## Guide
### Bingo sheet
* Chocolatear: Peruvian slang, to randomize and generate a new list of numbers to be picked. It'll restart the whole game.

* Generar Cartilla: To generate a new card using random numbers. You can generate as many cards as you want and share them with your friends using the "Screenshot" button!.

* Screenshot: It captures the card and copies it to your clipboard as a picture, ready to be shared.

* Sacar bolilla: To pick a number from the random list (refreshed every time Chocolatear is picked!)

### Settings sheet
* SacarBolaModoAutomatico: Boolean "SI" or "NO", it'll click automatically the "Sacar bolilla" button every X seconds, configurable.

* AutoMarcadoCartilla: Boolean "SI" or "NO", it'll mark your own card if the picked number matches with any of your card numbers.

* LeerBolillero: Boolean "SI" or "NO", Excel will actually read and speak the picked number. It uses your OS language.
